\section{\sectioncolor Introduction}
Signals and systems find many application in communications, automatic control, and form the basis for signal processing, communication, machine vision, and pattern recognition.   Electrical signals (voltages and currents in circuits, electromagnetic communication signals), acoustic signals, image and video signals, and biological signals are all example of signals that we encounter. They are functions of independent variables and carry information. We define a system as a mathematical relationship between an input signal and an output signal. We can use systems to analyze and modify signals. We can realize any systems using electrical and electronic  circuits (in addition to other systems like mechanical systems): The theoretical analysis that we do manifests in such circuits.   Circuits, Signals, and systems have brought about revolutionary changes. In this course we will study the fundamentals of circuits, signals, and systems. Types of signals in continuous time and discrete time, linear time-invariant (LTI) systems, Fourier series analysis  and realizing these systems in circuits are the core components of the course.

Chouse modules such as Signals and Systems, Digital Signal Processing, many chouse modules in the telecommunications pathway build on the fundamental knowledge that we would gain from this course module.

\section{\sectioncolor Learning Outcomes}
After completing this course you will be able to do the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Explain the fundamental tools in  electrical circuit analysis.
    \item Apply network theorems in analysing electrical circuits.
    \item Differentiate between continuous-time, discrete-time and digital signals, and techniques applicable to the analysis of each type.
    \item Use Fourier series techniques to understand frequency domain characteristics of signals.
    \item Apply appropriate theoretical principles to characterize the behaviour of Linear Time Invariant (LTI) systems.
\end{itemize}
